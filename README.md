# MY-PROCESSOR
A microprocessor (MIPS) which can perform basic athematic operations using Logism tool.

The processor we will be considering is the MIPS processor. The MIPS processor, designed in 1984 by researchers at Stanford University, is a RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) processor. Compared with their CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) counterparts (such as the Intel Pentium processors), RISC processors typically support fewer and much simpler instructions.
There are like different circ files which are build using logism tool and combined together to give a simple MIPS processor which can add,multiply,subtract and divide two different inputs which are given as a binary form.
